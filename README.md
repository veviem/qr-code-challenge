# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

Probably quite crappy, but hey I gave it a shot and that's really what counts right.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML & CSS
- Newbie skills learned from the beginning of UDEMY course "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" 
- Sweat, blood and tears and no small amount of chocolate, chips and soda.

### What I learned

-That I know basically nothing and jet I can still make something that looks somewhat decent.

-Starting out with markup semantics, though not there jet, this is just the beginning.

-Have had big problems with centering in CSS, which finally (momentarily at the very least) overcome by trial and error untill it finally sunk in (might forget it later, but let's hope it's in there for good). 

```css
.parentContainer {
  position: relative;
}
.childContainer {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
  margin: auto;
}
```
and

```css
.parentContainer {
  position: relative;
}
.childContainer {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

Will continue to develop my skills with positioning using css, but will also continue on with the UDEMY course to amass more skills and tools for bigger, harder challenges to come. Will also look further into markup semantics to learn to write legible code.

### Useful resources

- [Centering in css](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-a-div-with-css-10-different-ways/) - Helped with very basic, easy to understand explanations of how to center elements using css.
- [UDEMY](https://www.udemy.com/) - I suggest looking into the courses on this site if you are just starting out and want a hand with it. It's quite simple and well explained, although I am myself still just starting out which is why I tried out this beginner challenge.

## Acknowledgments

- [UDEMY](https://www.udemy.com/) - The reason I got into this challenge was one of the courses on UDEMY. It has greatly improved my understanding of what coding is and has given me the basic tools to start programming, although there is a long road ahead.
- Boyfriend needs a thanks for listening to me rant about shit he doesn't care about and not getting annoyed.
- Doggo for being my mentalhealth stabilizer and letting me hug out my frustrations. 

If anyone reads this I am positively surprised, since I probably wouldn't read through such random shit text, but you do you! All the best luck to you in your future endevours. Time to take my mentalhealth professional to the park for a treat after this.
